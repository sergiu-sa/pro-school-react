#  Square Eyes — FED1 Semester Project 1

**Square Eyes** is a responsive movie website originally built as Semester Project 1 for Noroff’s Front-End Development course. This version has been **refactored, redesigned, and improved** to better reflect professional web standards, meet portfolio brief criteria, and demonstrate my development and design process.

This site allows users to explore a selection of films and view featured details in a clean, modern layout. The project showcases semantic HTML, CSS layout skills (Flexbox & Grid), accessibility principles, responsive behavior, and attention to visual hierarchy and UX.
