# Square Eyes – Film Discovery Website

## Project Overview

Square Eyes is a fictional streaming and movie browsing platform created as part of Noroff’s Front-End Development coursework. This was an individual project where the goal was to practice semantic HTML, structured layouts, reusable components, and visual hierarchy.

The site allows users to browse a curated list of movies, view detailed information about each title, and simulate purchasing or adding to a watchlist. The project emphasizes accessibility, clean structure, responsive layout, and visually engaging presentation.
